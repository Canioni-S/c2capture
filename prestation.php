                    Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.
                    Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?</p>

                    How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. I hope I didn't brain my damage.
                    When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</p>

                    You don't vote for kings. How do you know she is a witch? We found them. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!
                    Well, I didn't vote for you. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>

                    What do you mean? We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. And the hat. She's a witch! Why do you think that she is a witch?
                    Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, I got better. We found them. Shut up!</p>

                    It doesn't look so shiny to me. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Why did you bring us here?
                    Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

                    Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? It's toe-tappingly tragic! It must be wonderful.
                    Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Then we'll go with that data file!
                    Belligerent and numerous. Bite my shiny metal ass. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>

                    Makes me a … scientist. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Watching ice melt. This is fun.
                    Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. This man is a knight in shining armor. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>

                    I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Makes me a … scientist. You all right, Dexter? He taught me a code. To survive. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.
                    I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</p>
